# Pycaret - Your Data Science Co-Pilot
This project repository is created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Programming for Data Science course offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota

# Introduction 
In todayâ€™s data-driven world, many organizations struggle to utilize data efficiently. A NewVantage Partners survey from 2021 found that 53% of executives cited budget constraints as a significant challenge in data projects. Consequently, businesses often begin with small-scale data projects and rely mostly on existing analysts to avoid hiring data scientists. As a result, business analysts frequently find themselves tasked with constructing advanced machine learning models quickly and confidently. This is where PyCaret comes in!

# Why Pycaret?
#### ðŸš€ Boost Model Productivity
In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, where 75% of organizations believe that expediting model development is critical for success in future AI initiatives, PyCaret emerges as a must-have tool. PyCaret is a versatile Python library meticulously designed to offer a low-code environment. This empowers citizen data scientists and business analysts to explore multiple model algorithms and hyperparameters quickly, all without the need for extensive coding expertise!

#### ðŸ’¡ Democratize Machine Learning
What sets PyCaret apart is its standing as one of the top 1% open-source libraries in Python. This distinction underscores PyCaret's mission to democratize machine learning, making it accessible to individuals from all walks of life. Furthermore, PyCaret integrates with numerous components of the existing AI and machine learning landscape, such as Shap, MLflow, and scikit-learn, making it a seamless addition to your toolkit.

#### âš’ Deployment Ready
With simply 4 lines of code, PyCaret can deploy a classification model for customer churn prediction, a regression model for sales forecasting, or a natural language processing model for sentiment analysis. PyCaret is equipped with the tools and knowledge to deploy these models effectively.

# Data Set
